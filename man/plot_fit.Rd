\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame. The experimental data in EMC2 format with at least \code{subject} (i.e., the
subject factor), \code{R} (i.e., the response factor) and \code{rt} (i.e., response time) variable.
Additional factor variables of the design are optional.}

\item{pp}{A data frame. Posterior predictives created by \code{post_predict()}}

\item{subject}{Integer or string selecting a subject from the data. If specified only that subject
is plotted. \code{NULL} (i.e., the default), will plot all subjects.}

\item{factors}{Character vector of factors in data to display separately. If
NULL (default) use names of all columns in data except "trials","R", and "rt".
Omitted factors are aggregated over. If NA treats entire data set as a single cell.}

\item{functions}{A named list of functions that create new factors which can then be
used by the factors and stat arguments.}

\item{stat}{A function that takes the data/the posterior predictives and returns a single value.
For the posterior predictives it will use a single value per replicate, which are then plotted as a density.}

\item{stat_name}{A string naming what the stat argument calculates, used in labeling the x-axis of the plot.}

\item{adjust}{Numeric. Density function bandwidth adjust parameter. See ``?density`}

\item{quants}{A vector. Quantiles of the posterior predictives to return when stat argument is supplied.}

\item{do_plot}{Boolean. Set to \code{FALSE} to only return the quantiles and omit the plots.}

\item{xlim}{A numeric vector. x-axis plot limit.}

\item{ylim}{A numeric vector. y-axis plot limit.}

\item{layout}{A vector specifying the layout as in \code{par(mfrow = layout)}.
If \code{NA} or \code{NULL} uses current plot window layout.}

\item{mfcol}{Boolean.  If \code{TRUE} uses par(mfrow = layout), otherwise uses par(mfcol = layout)}

\item{probs}{Vector of probabilities at which to calculate cumulative density function}

\item{data_lwd}{Integer. Line width for data}

\item{fit_lwd}{Integer. Line width for posterior predictives}

\item{q_points}{Vector. Quantile points to plot}

\item{qp_cex}{Numeric. Cex for data quantile points}

\item{pqp_cex}{Numeric. Cex for predicted quantile points}

\item{lpos}{Character. Legend position, see \code{?legend()}.}

\item{main}{Character. Pasted before the plot title, especially useful when specifying a stat argument.}
}
\value{
If stat argument is provided, a vector of observed values and predicted quantiles
is returned
}
\description{
Plot (defective) cumulative density functions of the observed data and data from the
posterior predictive distribution: the probability of a response,
p(R) as a function of response time for the experimental data and posterior
predictive simulations.
}
\details{
The data is plotted in black. Large grey points show the average quantiles across the posterior predictives.
The small grey points represent the predicted quantile of an individual replicate,
providing a representation of uncertainty in the model predictions.

If the stat argument is supplied (which calculates a statistic based on the data),
the posterior predictives are plotted as a density over the different replicates.
A vertical line is plotted at the value of that statistic for the experimental data.

If more than one subject is included, the data and fits are aggregated across subjects by default.

Also see \code{?plot_defective_density()} for more details.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# First generate posterior predictives based on a samplers object run with run_emc
pp <- post_predict(samplers, n_cores = 4)
# Then visualize the model fit
plot_fit(forstmann, pp, factors = c("S", "E"), layout = c(2,3))

# Specific statistics on the posterior predictives can also be specified
# This function calculates the difference in rt between two S levels.
# It takes the data (or the posterior predictives) as an argument
drt <- function(data) diff(tapply(data$rt,data[,c("S")],mean))
plot_fit(forstmann, pp, stat=drt,stat_name="Rt difference",
