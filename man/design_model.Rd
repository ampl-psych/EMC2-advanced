\title{Combines a data frame with a design to create
a data augmented design model ("dadm") object. Augmentation
refers to replicating the data with one row for each accumulator.}
\usage{
design_model(
  data,
  design,
  model = NULL,
  add_acc = TRUE,
  rt_resolution = 0.02,
  verbose = TRUE,
  compress = TRUE,
  rt_check = TRUE,
  add_da = FALSE,
  all_cells_dm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame}

\item{design}{matching design}

\item{model}{if model not an attribute of design can be supplied here}

\item{add_acc}{default TRUE creates and 'augmented' data frame, which
replicates and stacks the supplied data frame for each accumulator and
adds factors to represent accumulators: lR = latent response, with a level
for each response (R) represented by the accumulator and lM = latent match,
a logical indicating if the accumulator represents the correct response as
specified by the design's matchfun.}

\item{rt_resolution}{maximum resolution of rt, NULL = no rounding}

\item{verbose}{if true reports compression outcome}

\item{compress}{default TRUE only keeps unique rows in terms of all
parameter design matrices R, lR and rt (at a given resolution)}

\item{rt_check}{checks if any truncation and censoring specified in the design
are respected.}

\item{add_da}{Boolean. Whether to include the data in the output}

\item{all_cells_dm}{Boolean. Whether to include all levels of a factor in the output, even when one is dropped in the design}
}
\value{
a (possibly) augmented and compressed data frame with attributes
specifying the design and how to decompress ready supporting likelihood
computation
}
\description{
Usually called by make_samplers rather than directly by the user, except
where a dadm is needed for use with profile_pmwg.
}
\details{
Performs a series to checks to make sure data frame and design match and
(by default) augments the data frame by adding accumulator factors and
compresses the result for efficient likelihood calculation.
