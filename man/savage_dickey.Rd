\usage{
savage_dickey(
  samplers,
  parameter = NULL,
  H0 = 0,
  filter = "sample",
  subfilter = 0,
  fun = NULL,
  mapped = F,
  selection = "mu",
  do_plot = TRUE,
  xlim = NULL,
  subject = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{samplers}{A list, typically a \code{samplers}object, the output from \code{run_emc()}}

\item{parameter}{A string. A parameter which you want to compare to H0. Will not be used if a FUN is specified.}

\item{H0}{Numeric. The H0 value which you want to compare to}

\item{filter}{A string. Specifies which stage the samples are to be taken from
\code{"preburn"}, \code{"burn"}, \code{"adapt"}, or \code{"sample"}}

\item{subfilter}{An integer or vector. If it's an integer, iterations up until
he value set by \code{subfilter} will be excluded. If a vector is supplied, only the
iterations in the vector will be considered.}

\item{fun}{A function. Specifies an operation to be performed on the sampled or mapped parameters.}

\item{mapped}{A boolean. Whether the Bayes factor should be calculated for
parameters mapped back to the real design, only works with selection = 'mu'.}

\item{selection}{A string. The default is \code{mu}. Whether to do the operation on
the \code{alpha}, \code{mu}, \code{covariance}, \code{variance}, or \code{correlation} parameters.}

\item{do_plot}{Boolean. Whether to include a plot of the prior and posterior density. With circles at H0.}

\item{xlim}{Vector, the x-limits for the plot.}

\item{subject}{Character. If \code{type = "single"} and multiple subjects were ran in one model, this is required.}
}
\value{
The Bayes factor for the hypothesis against H0.
}
\description{
Can be used to approximate the Bayes factor for group-level mean effects.
}
\details{
Note this is different to the computation of the marginal deviance in \code{compare}
since it only considers the group level mean effect and not the whole model.
For details see: Wagenmakers, Lodewyckx, Kuriyal, & Grasman (2010).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Here the samplers object has an effect parameter (e.g. B_Eneutral),
# that maps onto a certain hypothesis.
# The hypothesis here is that B_Eneutral is different from zero.
# We can test whether there's a group-level effect of Eneutral on B:
savage_dickey(samplers, parameter = "B_Eneutral")
# Alternatively we can also test whether two parameters from each other
Bdiff <- function(p)diff(p[c("B_Eneutral","B_Eaccuracy")])
savage_dickey(samplers,fun=Bdiff)
}
